        <h1>Q.1: What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
        <p>
        <h4>Local Storage:</h4>
        Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity.
        Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
        The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing
        the amount of traffic between client and server.
        The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all
        current and future visits to the site.
        </p>
        <P>
        <h4>Session Storage:</h4>
        It is similar to localStorage.
        Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and
        available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is
        closed, the storage is deleted
        The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set​.

        <h1>Q.2: What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h1>
        <p>
        <h4> Global Scope</h4>
        The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
        global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
        function or conditional state can access that variable.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4> Block Scope</h4>
        Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables
        inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
        something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

        <h1>Q.3: How does event loop work in javascript?</h1>
        <p>
            The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
            empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. JavaScript has a runtime model
            based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and
            executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.

        <h1>Q.4: How to get undefined object in javascript?</h1>
        <p>
            undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value
            of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

            In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not
            the case, avoid overriding it.)

            A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
            undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
            undefined if a value was not returned.
